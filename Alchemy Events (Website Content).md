Ideas for Content tabs and Sub-headings on the website.

**Concept Note:** ALCHEMY EVENTS  
Keeping it minimalistic with respect to the number of tabs. More visual and website visitors should be able to scroll down to find more. Slideshow at the homepage with the best event pictures so far is suggested. The idea is to avoid the regular \- About Us, Services, Clients, Contact Us format. We have shared an outline of the website content with copywriting (marked in Italics) at the moment. Content will be elaborated in quick succession after idea approval.

Clarity of thought has been key to this growth story as the founder has, for as long as he can remember, been driven to organize events. As a student, as a professional and even as a family man, it is his zest for creating a beautiful and memorable experience that has studded Alchemy today among the big names in the events industry\!
